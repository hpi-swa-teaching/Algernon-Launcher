An ALGPrefixTreeNode is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; 
instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.
All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.
Values are not necessarily associated with every node.
